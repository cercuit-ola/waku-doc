# Introduction
Welcome to the Waku product documentation! This document is intended to provide a technical overview of the product and instructions for getting started with its features and capabilities.

# What is Waku?
Waku is a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and privacy-preserving communication network that allows users to send and receive messages without worrying about surveillance or deplatforming. Waku is being developed as a public good infrastructure and is being implemented in three open source versions: Nwaku, Js-waku, and Go-waku.

# Key Features
Decentralized architecture: Waku is built on a decentralized network that allows users to send and receive messages without relying on a central server or authority. This makes it resistant to censorship and allows users to maintain control over their own data.

Privacy-preserving: Waku uses encryption and anonymity techniques to protect the privacy of its users. Messages are encrypted end-to-end, and users can choose to use pseudonyms or remain anonymous.

Customizable: Waku allows users to customize their messaging experience with features such as message expiration, read receipts, and message history control.
